### Project Notes:
To get any files look in the assets folder

For scripts copy and paste because if you download they wil ask for the .meta file.

The reason there are 3 levels is that the Video Game Design Guidelines only allowed 3 levels.

If you have any other Questions please post an issue, not make a change, with the tag called QUESTIONS.

All in all thank you for all the hard work you guys have done this year 😄🎉

Update: There are 2 assets files, the real one is under TSA_VideoGame_Design... under the main repository
