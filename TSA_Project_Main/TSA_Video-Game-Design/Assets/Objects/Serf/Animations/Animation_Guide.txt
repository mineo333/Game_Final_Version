The Animation Controllers work as follows:
The 'Text' Animation Controller controls the movement of the Serf
The 'Axe' Animation Controller controls the Axe swing
The 'Wand' Animation Controller controls the wand movement
Note: The 'Off' Animations in both the Axe and Wand folders are there for a reason, please do not delete.
